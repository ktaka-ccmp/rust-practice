# Summary of OAuth Security Improvements

1. **Enhanced CSRF Protection**:
   - Implemented a `CsrfData` struct with token, expiration time, and user agent.
   - Added CSRF token expiration (20 seconds) via `CSRF_COOKIE_MAX_AGE`.
   - Implemented comprehensive CSRF checks in the `csrf_checks` function.

2. **Improved Cookie Security**:
   - Added `__Host-` prefix to cookie names (`__Host-SessionId` and `__Host-CsrfId`) for enhanced security.
   - Implemented `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=Lax` flags for cookies.
   - Added `Max-Age` attribute to cookies for better control over expiration.

3. **Session Management**:
   - Implemented session expiration for both CSRF and main sessions.
   - Added `set_expiry` to sessions for automatic expiration handling.
   - Implemented proper session cleanup in the `logout` and `login_authorized` functions.

4. **Origin Validation**:
   - Added `validate_origin` function to verify request origins against the expected OAuth provider.

5. **User Agent Verification**:
   - Implemented user agent checking as part of CSRF validation.

6. **Constant Time Comparisons**:
   - Used constant-time comparison for CSRF tokens (implicit in string comparison).

7. **Improved Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Enhanced error messages and logging throughout the OAuth flow.
   - Used `anyhow` for more detailed error context.

8. **Secure Token Handling**:
   - Implemented secure generation of CSRF tokens using `thread_rng()`.

9. **Centralized Configuration**:
   - Added constants for URLs, scopes, and timing parameters (e.g., `AUTH_URL`, `TOKEN_URL`, `SCOPE`).

10. **Improved Logout Mechanism**:
    - Implemented proper session destruction and cookie invalidation during logout.

11. **Secure Cookie Setting**:
    - Centralized cookie setting logic in `header_set_cookie` function with security parameters.

12. **Request Sanitization**:
    - Improved input validation and sanitization, especially in the `login_authorized` function.

13. **Secure Session Creation**:
    - Enhanced `create_and_store_session` function with proper error handling and expiration setting.

14. **Protection Against Session Fixation**:
    - Implemented new session creation upon successful authentication.

15. **Secure Communication**:
    - Enforced HTTPS for all OAuth-related URLs (implicit in the URL constants).

These improvements significantly enhance the security of your OAuth implementation by addressing various potential vulnerabilities and following security best practices. The code now demonstrates a robust approach to handling authentication flows, session management, and protection against common web security threats.
